## Prompt

```text
Project Name: Todo AI Chatbot (Reusable Intelligence + MCP)

Core Laws:
1. Spec-Driven Development mandatory
2. No manual coding at any stage
3. All code generated by AI agents
4. Agents & skills are reusable intelligence
5. Backend stateless; no in-memory state allowed
6. All state persisted in Neon PostgreSQL
7. Agents interact ONLY via MCP tools
8. MCP server must use Official MCP SDK
9. OpenAI Agents SDK must be used for agent logic
10. FastAPI must be used for backend
11. SQLModel must be used for ORM
12. ChatKit must be used for frontend
13. Authentication via Better Auth
14. Tool chaining supported
15. Errors handled gracefully
16. System survives server restarts

Prohibited:
- Manual code writing
- Hardcoded business logic in backend
- Direct DB access by agents
- Deviating from MCP tool specs
```

## Response snapshot

Created the initial project constitution v1.0.0 for Todo AI Chatbot (Reusable Intelligence + MCP).

The constitution establishes 16 core principles organized into:

**Core Principles:**
1. Spec-Driven Development - mandatory SDD methodology
2. AI-Generated Code Only - no manual coding permitted
3. Reusable Intelligence - agents as composable units
4. Stateless Backend Architecture - no in-memory state
5. Database as Single Source of Truth - Neon PostgreSQL only
6. MCP-Only Agent Interactions - standardized protocol
7. Official MCP SDK Mandate - no custom implementations
8. OpenAI Agents SDK Requirement - standardized agent framework
9. FastAPI Backend Framework - required web framework
10. SQLModel ORM Requirement - type-safe database interactions
11. ChatKit Frontend Framework - chat UI standard
12. Better Auth Authentication - secure auth standard
13. Tool Chaining Support - workflow composition
14. Graceful Error Handling - clear, actionable messages
15. Restart Resilience - survive server restarts
16. No Hardcoded Business Logic - agent-driven logic

**Additional Sections:**
- Technology Stack Requirements (required/prohibited technologies)
- State Management Requirements (persistence and database access rules)
- Governance (amendment procedures, compliance requirements, version control)

All 16 principles include clear rationale explaining the "why" behind each rule. The constitution uses semantic versioning (1.0.0) and includes a sync impact report documenting template alignment.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established as authoritative governance document for Todo AI Chatbot
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (195 lines), this PHR
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specifications following SDD principle, setup backend/frontend structure per tech stack requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear, testable principles with strong rationale. 16 principles cover development methodology, architecture, technology choices, and operational requirements. Templates are aligned via sync impact report.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - initial creation completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (manual review required for governance doc)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.constitution workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution compliance during first feature specification creation
