  }
}
```

  "data": {
    "deleted_id": 123
  },

  "success": false,
  "error": "Database error occurred",
  "code": "DATABASE_ERROR",

    "message": "Failed to delete task from database"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage
```json
{
  "task_id": 123
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- Performs permanent deletion (no soft delete)
- Validates that task_id is a positive integer
- Returns confirmation of the deleted task ID
- Validates task exists before attempting deletion
